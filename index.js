// null Data Type

// In the JS, null is a special value that represents empty or unknown value.

let number = null;

console.log(number);
console.log(typeof number);

// the type should be "null" but it is "object" because null is an object.

// It is a known bug in JS.

// JS defines that null is equavalent to undefined.

console.log(null == undefined); // (==) it is a comparision operator.
